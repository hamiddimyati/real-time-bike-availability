# MLLib (through Scala) to process our data

The models are in the notebook (models.ipynb). We train them and save the model as an RDD.

## Example

As an example, see the Decision Tree model, trained with Spark MLLib, and saved as `decision_tree.model`.

## TODO

- Try other models
- Tune the models hyperparameters
- Use the whole dataset (year 2019) for training
